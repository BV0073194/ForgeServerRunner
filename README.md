# ForgeServer

## Description

**ForgeServer** is a user-friendly desktop application designed to simplify the process of launching and managing Minecraft Forge servers, specifically for the version **1.16.5-36.2.42**. This tool provides an intuitive interface to customize server settings, manage worlds, and optimize server performance, offering a seamless experience for both novice and advanced users.

## Key Features

- **Customizable Memory Settings**:
  - Easily specify the maximum (`Xmx`) and minimum (`Xms`) memory allocation for the Java process, optimizing performance based on your hardware.

- **Server Configuration Panel**:
  - A dedicated interface for editing `server.properties`, adding/removing mods, managing worlds, and configuring server behavior.

- **PlayIt.gg Support**:
  - Integrated support for **PlayIt.gg**, enabling simple tunneling and sharing of your server with friends. 
  - Debug mode allows monitoring of PlayIt.gg's real-time output in a dedicated window.

- **Real-Time Server Monitoring**:
  - Captures and displays server output and error messages in the console for easy troubleshooting.

- **World and Mod Management**:
  - Intuitive interfaces for adding, renaming, and managing server worlds and mods directly from the app.

- **Error Handling**:
  - Comprehensive feedback and error reporting ensure users can quickly resolve issues during setup or runtime.

- **Cross-Process Management**:
  - Ensures that all related processes (e.g., server, PlayIt.gg) are properly handled and terminated when closing the main window.
